A new beginning

 &lt;p&gt; This is a post to clerify the usage of this site. One this site was created in order to demonstrate the knowledge that I will accumulate over time during my time in college. Two I accidently deleted all my web files from the previous site I was worked on over the past year (3 AM and I actually did the rm -rf command and I also deleted my backup files thinking I didnt need them. Yeah.) Hopefully this one will be even better than the previous one. Third I'll be posting guides and once in a blue moon something more intimate. I think that's all I'm going to type since I been going on with 4 hours of sleep this entire day... night.  &lt;/p&gt;
